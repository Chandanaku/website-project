# Simple Web-Site

### Emotion Themed website

A simple static HTML website that textually explores human emotions. This project showcases basic HTML and CSS styling and is designed for educational and beginner practice purposes.

---

The project was started by creating a new local repository using Git. Initial development took place on the main branch, and changes were committed and pushed to the GitHub cloud repository. Additional enhancements were developed in feature branches and merged back into main to simulate real-world collaborative workflows.

#### Features

1.Navigation Menu and Header: A simple navigation bar is implemented with placeholder links to sections such as Home, About, and Contact. The site welcomes users with a central heading.
2.Footer Integration: A new footer branch was created to implement and test the footer. It includes copyright information and was later merged into main.
3.Featured Image and Description: The site includes a vibrant image that represents human emotions, accompanied by a brief paragraph to describe the visual theme.
4.Contact Form: A basic contact form was created with input fields for name, email, and message. This form serves as a UI element only (no backend logic yet).
5.Testimonials Section: A section was added to display motivational quotes related to emotions using the blockquote tag for semantic HTML structure.
